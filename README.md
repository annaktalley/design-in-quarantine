About: Design in Quarantine was founded in April of 2020 in order to document and preserve in real time design responses to the Coronavirus pandemic. We feel that it is urgent for design historians to respond as swiftly to the coronavirus pandemic as designers are themselves. The closure of museums, libraries, and archives has forced a shift upon traditional design history research methodologies and forms of archiving. Inspired by the technique of rapid-response curation in museums, the digital collection of this archive is a real-time example of changing research methods in light of recent events.
Founders: Design in Quarantine is a project by Fleur Elkerton and Anna Talley, postgraduate design historians at the Royal College of Art and the Victoria & Albert Museum in London, England.
